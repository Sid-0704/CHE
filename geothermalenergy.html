            <p class="list_content">
                Geothermal energy is thermal energy extracted from the Earth's crust. It combines energy from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay. Geothermal energy has been exploited as a source of heat and/or electric power for millennia.
                Geothermal heating, using water from hot springs, for example, has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since Roman times. Geothermal power, (generation of electricity from geothermal energy), has been used since the 20th century.
                <br>Geothermal power is considered to be a renewable energy because heat extraction rates are insignificant compared to the Earth's heat content.

        <ul>
            <li class="list"><b>It is Environmentally Friendly</b></li>
            <p class="list_content">
                Geothermal energy is more environmentally friendly than conventional fuel sources such as coal and other fossil fuels. In addition, the carbon footprint of a geothermal power plant is low.
                 While there is some pollution associated with geothermal energy, this is relatively minimal when compared to fossil fuels. 
            </p>
            
            <li class="list"><b>It is Renewable</b></li>
            <p class="list_content">
                Geothermal energy is a source of renewable energy that will last until the Earth is destroyed by the sun in around 5 billion years.
                 The hot reservoirs within the Earth are naturally replenished, making it both renewable and sustainable.
            </p>

            
            <li class="list"><b>Rapid Evolution Of Geothermal Energy</b></li>
            <p class="list_content">
                There is a great deal of exploration into geothermal energy at the moment, meaning that new technologies are being created to improve the energy process. 
                There are an increasing number of projects to improve and grow this area of industry. With this rapid evolution many of the current cons of geothermal energy will be mitigated against.

            </p>

            <li class="list"><b>No Fuel Requirement </b></li>
            <p class="list_content">
                Since geothermal energy is a naturally occurring resource there is no fuel required,
                 such as with fossil fuels that are a finite resource which needs mining or otherwise extracting from the earth.

        <ul>
            <li class="list"><b>It is Location Restricted</b></li>
            
                <p class="list_content">
                    The largest single disadvantage of geothermal energy is that it is location specific. Geothermal plants need to be built in places where the energy is accessible, which means that some areas are not able to exploit this resource.
                     Of course, this is not a problem if you live in a place where geothermal energy is readily accessible, such as Iceland.
                </p>
            <li class="list"><b>High Costs</b></li>
                <p class="list_content">
                    Geothermal energy is an expensive resource to tap into, 
                    with price tags ranging from around $2-$7 million for a plant with a 1 megawatt capacity. However, where the upfront costs are high, the outlay can be recouped as part of a long-term investment.

        <span class="sub_head"><u>INDIA'S INVESTMENT/DEVELOPMENTS IN GEOTHERMAL ENERGY</u></span>
        <p class="list_content">
            As of now, India's engagement with geothermal energy is primarily focused on direct uses like bathing, 
            heating, and agriculture, especially in regions like Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Gujarat. <br>
            Despite the high potential, the installation of geothermal power plants and the utilization of this energy for electricity generation remain limited.
             This gap presents a unique opportunity for India to explore and expand its geothermal energy capabilities.
